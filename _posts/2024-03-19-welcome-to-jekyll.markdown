Hi! This is [Manisha Natarajan](https://manishanatarajan.github.io/). I am a Robotics PhD student at Georgia Tech and I 
use this blog to share my notes on different technical concepts that I'm currently working on or have previously encountered in my 
research. For all my posts, I plan to explain the concepts at three levels:


    Level 1 (TLDR): High-level overview without any math
    Level 2 (Moderate): More details, excluding in-depth proofs
    Level 3 (Intense): Go deep into explaining and include mathematical proofs

Please feel free to comment if you have any questions or find any mistakes!
